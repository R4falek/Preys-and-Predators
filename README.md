# Preys and Predators

This repository contains the implementation of Preys and Predators, a project developed for a BSc thesis. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the synergy between neural networks and genetic algorithms by simulating a dynamic environment with agents representing prey and predator behavior.

## Features
- Custom Neural Network for decision-making
- Genetic Algorithm for evolving behaviors
- Real-time visualization with Pygame
